# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on comprehensive visual optimization of the light theme (Day/Nova/Light Theme) mode to create a clean, refreshing interface suitable for daytime environments. The optimization maintains consistent layout structure with dark mode while implementing appropriate color schemes, contrast ratios, and visual hierarchy for optimal readability and user experience in bright environments.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user working in bright daytime environments, I want a visually optimized light theme that provides excellent readability and reduced eye strain, so that I can comfortably use the application during daylight hours.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the light theme is active THEN the overall background SHALL use high-brightness, low-saturation light colors (warm white or light gray with subtle gradients)
2. WHEN displaying the interface THEN dark color blocks (blue-gray, brown-gray) SHALL be avoided to maintain visual lightness
3. WHEN rendering text THEN primary text SHALL use deep gray or pure black (#1A1A1A to #202225) for optimal contrast
4. WHEN displaying secondary text THEN subtitle and auxiliary text SHALL use #4A4A4A or #5A6475 for good contrast without being harsh

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user navigating the interface, I want title panels and headers that maintain visual hierarchy while being appropriate for light backgrounds, so that I can easily identify different sections and content areas.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying title panels THEN they SHALL maintain existing rounded rectangle and shadow structure with light backgrounds (#F3F6FA or equivalent tokens)
2. WHEN applying shadows THEN they SHALL be reduced to shadow-md or shadow-lg with lower black transparency
3. WHEN displaying titles THEN blue colors SHALL be replaced with softer bright blue (#1E90FF or theme tokens)
4. WHEN rendering title backgrounds THEN subtle gradients or hollow effects SHALL be used to highlight hierarchy

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user interacting with buttons and controls, I want button styles that are clearly visible and appropriately styled for light backgrounds, so that I can easily identify and interact with interface elements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying capsule buttons THEN they SHALL use light background with dark text or dark border with light fill for "daytime" style
2. WHEN rendering common buttons THEN they SHALL use theme blue borders or gradients (border-sky-500 + bg-sky-50)
3. WHEN displaying button text THEN colors SHALL be unified to #1E3A8A or #0F172A dark blue
4. WHEN showing emphasis buttons (Delete) THEN they SHALL maintain high contrast red with light background (#FEE2E2) to reduce visual pressure
5. WHEN hovering or activating buttons THEN states SHALL be visible on light backgrounds through darker borders or backgrounds

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user viewing content cards and panels, I want consistent visual styling that maintains readability and hierarchy, so that I can easily scan and understand the interface layout.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying card areas (templates, exercise creation) THEN they SHALL maintain consistent light panel styling with coordinated padding, rounded corners, and shadow hierarchy
2. WHEN rendering card titles THEN blue colors SHALL be replaced with light blue series matching title styling to avoid button conflicts
3. WHEN showing global separators THEN they SHALL use low-contrast light gray (border-slate-200, border-slate-300)
4. WHEN displaying bottom backgrounds THEN they SHALL avoid dark gray or black separator lines

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user viewing icons and visual elements, I want all graphical elements to be clearly visible and appropriately styled for light backgrounds, so that I can easily understand visual cues and navigation elements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying icons THEN they SHALL be clearly identifiable on light backgrounds
2. WHEN current icons are gray-based THEN they SHALL be changed to dark blue or dark gray
3. WHEN background gradients are needed THEN they SHALL use soft top-left to bottom-right light blue to white transitions
4. WHEN rendering backgrounds THEN large blocks of solid color SHALL be avoided

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the theme system, I want proper theme switching logic that maintains component reusability, so that both light and dark modes can coexist without code duplication.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing theme switching THEN components SHALL be shared between light and dark modes
2. WHEN applying light mode styles THEN they SHALL use Tailwind's light: prefix or data-theme="light" state variable overrides
3. WHEN styling components THEN inline styles SHALL be avoided in favor of CSS classes
4. WHEN necessary THEN semantic color variables SHALL be added to tailwind.config.js for light mode (brand.lightBackground, brand.lightPrimary)

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user on different devices and screen sizes, I want the light theme to work consistently across all viewport sizes, so that I have a consistent experience regardless of my device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing on 1440px resolution THEN title panels, button layouts, and card hierarchy SHALL be clearly visible
2. WHEN viewing on 1280px resolution THEN all visual elements SHALL maintain proper spacing and readability
3. WHEN viewing on 1024px resolution THEN responsive design SHALL preserve visual hierarchy
4. WHEN viewing on 768px resolution THEN mobile layout SHALL maintain light theme styling consistency

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user switching between themes, I want smooth transitions without visual glitches, so that I can seamlessly change between light and dark modes based on my environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN switching from dark to light mode THEN there SHALL be no flickering or style remnants
2. WHEN switching from light to dark mode THEN the original dark mode SHALL remain unchanged
3. WHEN theme switching occurs THEN all components SHALL update consistently
4. WHEN page loads THEN the correct theme SHALL be applied immediately without flash

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a user with accessibility needs, I want the light theme to meet accessibility standards for contrast and readability, so that I can use the application comfortably regardless of visual capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN measuring text contrast THEN it SHALL meet WCAG AA requirements with at least 4.5:1 ratio for normal text
2. WHEN running accessibility checks THEN color combinations SHALL pass automated contrast validation
3. WHEN using screen readers THEN visual changes SHALL not affect semantic structure
4. WHEN viewing with color blindness THEN interface elements SHALL remain distinguishable through contrast rather than color alone
