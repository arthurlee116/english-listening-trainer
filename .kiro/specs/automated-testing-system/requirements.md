# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for implementing a comprehensive automated testing system for the english-listening-trainer Next.js/TypeScript project. The system must rebuild the entire testing infrastructure from scratch, providing unit, integration, and end-to-end test coverage for all critical application flows including specialized listening practice, achievements tracking, focus metrics, and AI-powered features.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a well-structured test architecture so that I can efficiently write and maintain tests for different application layers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up the test structure THEN the system SHALL create separate directories for unit, integration, and e2e tests
2. WHEN organizing test files THEN the system SHALL follow consistent naming conventions (*.test.ts for unit, *.spec.ts for integration)
3. WHEN creating shared utilities THEN the system SHALL provide centralized mocks and helpers for common testing scenarios
4. WHEN structuring fixtures THEN the system SHALL organize test data logically with realistic focus area data and AI responses

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper test configuration and tooling so that tests run reliably in different environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring Vitest THEN the system SHALL ensure proper TypeScript support and jsdom environment setup
2. WHEN setting up Testing Library THEN the system SHALL provide custom render utilities with i18n and theme providers
3. WHEN integrating with ESLint THEN the system SHALL enforce testing best practices and code quality
4. WHEN running tests THEN the system SHALL support both watch mode for development and run mode for CI

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive unit test coverage so that core business logic is thoroughly validated.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing storage utilities THEN the system SHALL verify localStorage persistence and data conversion functions
2. WHEN testing achievement service THEN the system SHALL validate minutes accumulation and goal progress calculations
3. WHEN testing hotkeys functionality THEN the system SHALL verify state synchronization and enable/disable behavior
4. WHEN testing focus metrics THEN the system SHALL validate statistics calculations and recommendation algorithms
5. WHEN testing utility functions THEN the system SHALL achieve minimum 80% line coverage for critical business logic

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want integration and component tests so that user interactions and data flow are properly validated.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing main application flow THEN the system SHALL verify specialized practice mode persistence and duration recording
2. WHEN testing question interface THEN the system SHALL validate answer submission and specialized tag handling
3. WHEN testing results display THEN the system SHALL verify specialized data rendering and fallback scenarios
4. WHEN testing history panel THEN the system SHALL validate data persistence and retrieval with proper error handling
5. WHEN testing API routes THEN the system SHALL verify payload processing and specialized field handling with mocked Prisma

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want effective mocking strategies so that tests are isolated and don't depend on external services.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN mocking external APIs THEN the system SHALL use MSW or lightweight fetch mocks for AI/TTS endpoints
2. WHEN mocking browser APIs THEN the system SHALL provide localStorage and window API mocks for Node environment
3. WHEN mocking database operations THEN the system SHALL implement Prisma mocking without real database calls
4. WHEN mocking i18n THEN the system SHALL provide translation mocks that don't break component rendering

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want quality gates and documentation so that testing standards are maintained and new contributors can easily extend the test suite.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN defining coverage thresholds THEN the system SHALL enforce minimum 70% line coverage and 60% branch coverage
2. WHEN running targeted tests THEN the system SHALL support CLI commands for specific test suites
3. WHEN documenting the system THEN the system SHALL provide clear setup instructions and usage examples
4. WHEN onboarding new developers THEN the system SHALL include migration notes and extension guidelines

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want end-to-end test coverage so that critical user journeys are validated.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing complete workflows THEN the system SHALL verify "generate → answer → results" flow with mocked network calls
2. WHEN testing specialized practice THEN the system SHALL validate focus area selection and coverage tracking
3. WHEN testing achievements THEN the system SHALL verify minute tracking and goal completion flows
4. WHEN running e2e tests THEN the system SHALL complete within reasonable time limits (under 30 seconds per test)

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want deterministic and fast tests so that the development workflow is not disrupted.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running tests THEN the system SHALL complete all unit tests within 10 seconds
2. WHEN executing tests multiple times THEN the system SHALL produce consistent results without flakiness
3. WHEN isolating tests THEN the system SHALL ensure no test affects another test's state
4. WHEN mocking time-dependent functions THEN the system SHALL use deterministic time values for consistent results
