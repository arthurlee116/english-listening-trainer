# Wrong Answers AI Analysis - User Guide

## Overview

The Wrong Answers AI Analysis feature helps you understand your mistakes and improve your English listening skills through detailed AI-powered explanations. This guide will walk you through all the features and how to use them effectively.

## Getting Started

### Automatic Data Migration

**What gets imported:**
- All your previous practice sessions
- Questions and your answers
- Session metadata (topic, difficulty, date)

**Note:** After successful import, your local data is cleared to prevent duplicates. Your data is now safely stored in the database and will sync across all your devices.
